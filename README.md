Handles missing values and basic connection errors


Project Structure

scraper.py → main scraping script

requirements.txt → dependencies

output.csv → scraped data sample



How to Run

1. Clone the repository using git clone.


2. Install required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.


3. Run the script with python scraper.py.

Future Improvements

Add support for scraping from multiple websites

Store data in a database instead of CSV

Automate the scraping process with scheduling
